# 👋 Hi, I'm Quwam Ogunlaja

I'm a **full-stack developer** with a passion for building clean, efficient systems on the web.

### 🛠 What I Do

- 🧑‍💻 Full-Stack Development  
  I build scalable web applications with modern technologies on both the frontend and backend.

- ⚙️ Systems & Low-Level Programming  
  I enjoy exploring how things work at a deeper level. I once wrote a **CHIP-8 emulator** from scratch—just for the fun of it.

- 🔌 Logic Design & Hardware  
  I dabble in **VHDL** and have designed a few digital circuits, including components for a RISC-style processor on an FPGA.

- 🔐 Solana Smart Contracts  
  I write Solana programs using **Rust**, diving into the world of decentralised finance and blockchain logic.

### 💻 Languages I Use

- **JavaScript / TypeScript** – For building rich, responsive frontends and powerful backend APIs  
- **Rust** – For smart contracts, systems programming, and when performance and safety matter  
- **C#** – For web APIs  
- **Python** – For scripting, automation, and the occasional data crunching

### 🧠 Interests

- Web & API design    
- Emulators & virtual machines  
- Digital logic & hardware prototyping
- Blockchain
